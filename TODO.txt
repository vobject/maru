Low-level coding notes:

- Orekit propagator objects are always recreated
- rename ICoreModelListener.propagatablesChanged() or get rid of CoreModel.changeScenarioElementsTime() altogether by proagating (elem.currentTimeChanged()) all scenario element whenever the scenarios current time changes automatically inside ScenarioModelManager ----> we cannot get rid of changeScenarioElementsTime() easily because it is used for Real-time mode!
- Bug: delete StartTimepoint, currenttime will not be updated.
- change stepSize type to double
- add custom central body where attributes can be changed; pre defined central bodies are constant
- remove central body alteration interfaces from maru.core. for the core data model, the central body should be immutable. but it may be altered using property pages from inside maru.centralbody plugin
- add move central bodies
- disallow TLE satellites for central bodies other than Earth
- add notifyXZYchanged() functions to CoreModel to indicate changes to a property of a scenario element that could not be expressed through standard CoreModel interfaces (e.g. implementation details were changed by the owning plugin) but CoreModelListeners should be notified nevertheless.
- create scenario project specific settings. then, move Image/Color/Texture out of the coremodel and into the new ui-settings-model.
- fix JOGL redraw issue for Linux/Mac
- add more Orbit types (OrbitWizard?) from Orekit
- image-combobox
- allow keplerian satellites to change its Date
- Date-Selction Control: a SWT Text control with a popup dialog that enables the user to select a date (via calender) and time
- make true anomaly the default anomaly type of the enire application -> sensible? currently it's mean anomaly. -> true anomaly is less computation, but it seems orekit-internal classes prefer MEAN anomaly type.
- should ICoordinate have a reference to a centralbody?
