Low-level coding notes:

--> Architecture/Protocol
- rename ICoreModelListener.propagatablesChanged() or get rid of CoreModel.changeScenarioElementsTime() altogether by proagating (elem.currentTimeChanged()) all scenario element whenever the scenarios current time changes automatically inside ScenarioModelManager ----> we cannot get rid of changeScenarioElementsTime() easily because it is used for Real-time mode!
- add notifyXZYchanged() functions to CoreModel to indicate changes to a property of a scenario element that could not be expressed through standard CoreModel interfaces (e.g. implementation details were changed by the owning plugin) but CoreModelListeners should be notified nevertheless.
- migrate protocol to a command-pattern-based approach
- make the scenario timeframe less of a central property and more of a second class citizen (like in STK)
- move the coordinates (GeodeticPoint and elevation) into its own ICoordinate implementation -> sensible?

--> User Interface
- change stepSize type to double
- image-combobox
- Date-Selction Control: a SWT Text control with a popup dialog that enables the user to select a date (via calender) and time -> can be used in timeline, scenario-propertypage, scenario-creation-wizard
- report plugin preferences: add font/size selection
- split up satellite-creation-wizard into: name/comment/color/image -> orbit -> propagator
- modal Waiting-Dialogs for long-lasting operations like in eclipse
- disallow TLE satellites for central bodies other than Earth
- Replace Internals-View with output of the selected element on the map view -> sensible?

--> Per-Scenario settings
- UiProject should have its own PreferenceStore that other plugins can query
- create scenario project specific settings. then, move Image/Color/Texture out of the coremodel and into the new ui-settings-model.
- Activate/Deactivate scenario elements via property pages (ui or map?)

--> Customization
- maru.ini that limits the amount of memory to e.g. 1024MiB sensible?

--> Bugs
- delete StartTimepoint, currenttime will not be updated.
- it is possible to add elements with the same name -> tested with ground stations
- when jogl awt_swt bridged window is created with negative x-coordinates, the application freezes

--> Misc
- clear propagator cache after report creation sensible? -> non-critical for performance
- fix JOGL redraw issue for Linux/Mac


Goals for Maru v1.3:
- Project-specific preferences/properties
- Integrate more Propagators from Orekit and their options
- Fix Linux and OSX issues -> Linux issues done, but needs testing
- add OSX JOGL fragment
- Maven build script that can also export the data model bindings (core, centralbody, groundstation, spacecraft)
- UI improvements
- get rid of debug/release-specific feature/product -> put maru.ui.debug into maru.ui plugin and activate it in the preferences
- non-copyright infinging splashscreen
